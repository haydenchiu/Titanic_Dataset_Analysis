# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

### Introduction
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
This dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, age, sex, ticket class, and other features.

### Data Exploration
In this EDA, we performed a number of exploratory analyses on the Titanic dataset, including:

-Visualizations of the distribution of different features, such as age, gender, and passenger class against survival
-Association between different features, such as the relationship between age and survival status

### Methods
We performed the analysis using Python and the following libraries:

-Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
-NumPy: for mathematical operations and array manipulation
-Matplotlib: for data visualization
-Seaborn: for statistical data visualization
-scipy.stats: for chi-square test

### Results
The analysis revealed a number of interesting findings about the Titanic dataset, including:

-Survival status is associated to passenger class
-Survival status is associated to gender (Female having significately higher survival rate than Male.)
-Survival status is associated to age
